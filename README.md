## ðŸ“– About
Gig workers often face challenges when applying for loans due to irregular income and lack of formal credit history.  
Our **AI Loan Officer** uses a custom-trained machine learning model to **predict repayment probability**, make **loan approval/rejection decisions**, and even **recommend loan terms and interest rates** tailored to each applicantâ€™s profile.
